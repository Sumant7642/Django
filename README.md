# Django

Many Users will store the files in the server and share with other users but the information in the server is not encrypted so it cannot be secure so, we proposed this web application. In this project, we can encrypt the userâ€™s uploaded files 
and we can also generate a secret key if any user requests for the file then we can verify and respond to their requests. Using the key, he can access the file. 

User Manual:
The user will register into the application by providing all the necessary details  and therefore he can log in into the application using username and password and the user can upload the files to cloud and share with the other registered users. He can also view the files uploaded by him and can also view the requests 
for a secret key from the other users and we can respond and the key will be sent to his registered email. Using that key, he can download the file and view the information.

Technologies Used: 
Python language 
Django framework 
Sqlite database 
Aes algorithm for ecryption and decryption 
Bootstrap,html,css for styling 
Javascript for the aes operatio
